## Why Soju?

- ✅ Preview a track's album, or any album/playlist
  - No more interrupting your current queue
  - No more clicking to the middle of a song for the good stuff<br><br>
- ✅ Compare songs between other albums/playlists
  - No more waiting for pages to load as you're jumping around, when you just want to hear samples quickly<br><br>
- ✅ A real privacy frontend for Spotify data
  - Many "Spotify frontends" play songs through YouTube (often wrong or a copycat). Soju represents a promise that only the original Spotify data direct from the source will be displayed.<br><br>
