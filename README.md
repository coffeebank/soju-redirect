# Soju Redirect

This is a Firefox addon for redirecting Spotify links to Soju.

Soju lets you explore music from Spotify on any device easily. Soju fetches music metadata from Spotify and allows you to quickly preview tracks, albums, and playlists before choosing to add it to your Spotify account. Soju uses Netlify Functions and Netlify CDN, securing your access to Spotify.

 - No more interrupting your current queue
 - No more waiting for songs to load as you're jumping around, when you just want to hear samples quickly
 - No more unhappy Apple Music friends who couldn't get Spotify to work
